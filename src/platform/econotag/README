Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running interactive PyMite on the
`Redbee Econotag`_.  A POSIX-compliant OS (Mac OS X, Linux) is required.
Using the Cygwin_ environment within Windows might work.

.. _`Redbee Econotag`: http://redwirellc.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=56
.. _Cygwin: http://www.cygwin.com/


Requirements
------------

In addition to PyMite's standard requirements, this platform also requires
``git`` to obtain the libmc1322x third party library.

The GCC for ARM is highly recommended to build for this platform.  All of the
build scripts and Makefiles are tailored to use the ``arm-none-eabi-gcc``
toolchain.  A good way to build the ``arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain`` is to use
the build assistant found here: http://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/

Be sure you have installed every dependency listed and
perform each preparation step shown on that page!


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean PyMite tree.  Run ``make once`` in the directory this file
is in to download a required third-party library::

    $ cd src/platform/econotag
    $ make once

Then build from the base of the project::

    $ cd ../../..
    $ make PLATFORM=econotag

The default sample project is to run the interactive prompt, ipm.
Read ``docs/src/InteractivePyMite.txt`` to learn how to run ipm.
