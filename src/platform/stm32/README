The STM32 Platform Project
==========================


:Author:    James Snyder


Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running interactive PyMite (ipm)
on the `ET-STM32 Stamp Module`_, which is an STM32 processor on a stamp-type
board.  The STM32 has an ARM Cortex M3 core.

Building the Project
--------------------

:Note: This platform does not have Makefile build support.

Follow `this explanation`_ to build ARM EABI GCC tools, then run 
``scons PLATFORM=stm32`` from the trunk directory.
