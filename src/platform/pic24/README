Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates the use of PyMite on the
`PIC24/dsPIC33 family`_ of microcontrollers.  Any PIC with at least 64 KiB of
program memory and 4 KiB of RAM can run PyMite.

.. _`PIC24 family`: http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=2629&param=en533465

Details
-------

This sample project demonstrates a simple use case of PyMite on a
microcontroller.  The file ``main.c`` is used to initialize PyMite
and indicate the name of the module it should run.  In this case, it
will run the module ``main.py``

In the module ``main.py``, we see that the program prints a "Hello world"
message, defines and runs an initialization function and then execute ipm.


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean PyMite tree.  Edit the ``src/platform/avr/Makefile`` 
near line 14 to set the part number of your PIC.

``platform/pic24/Makefile`` will build the PyMite VM archive as well as the 
sample application::

    $ cd src/platform/pic24
    $ make

As a second alternative, the p14p.mcp project file loaded into the Microchip
MPLAB IDE will build *most* of the project; support for translation of Python
to C files isn't yet included.


Flashing the Binary
-------------------

The steps above result in the binary file that need to go on the PIC.
The Makefile is configured for use with the `Bully Bootloader`_. Alternatively,
us a PICKit2/3 to program your PIC.
