Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates the use of PyMite on the
`AVR family`_ of microcontrollers.  Any AVR with at least 64 KiB of
program memory and 4 KiB of RAM can run PyMite.

.. _`AVR family`: http://www.atmel.com/products/AVR/

Details
-------

This sample project demonstrates a simple use case of PyMite on a
microcontroller.  The file ``sample.c`` is used to initialize PyMite
and indicate the name of the module it should run.  In this case, it
will run the module ``sample.py``

In the module ``sample.py``, we see that the program prints a "Hello world"
message, defines and runs an initialization function and then imports the
``avr`` module that is provided by PyMite.  The function ``avr.portA()`` is
called with the argument ``0xaa`` which will set the Port A pins to binary
``10101010``.  Afterwards, another print statement warns of a pending error.
This is followed by a call to the function ``foo()`` which, because it is not
defined, will generate a NameError and an exception and traceback will be
printed out the AVR's serial port.


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean PyMite tree.  Edit the ``src/sample/avr/Makefile`` near
line 42 to set the type of AVR you are using and near line 42 to set the
frequency of your AVR's main clock.  The default values are::

    MCU = atmega103
    F_CPU = 4000000UL

Then build the PyMite archive with ``TARGET=AVR`` and this sample project.::

    $ make TARGET=AVR
    $ cd src/sample/avr
    $ make


Flashing the Binary
-------------------

The steps above result in the binary file(s) that need to go on the AVR.
The Makefile is configured to use avrdude with an stk500v2 compatible
programmer.  If this matches your configuration, or you change the Makefile
to match your configuration, then you connect your device and type::

    $ make program

Otherwise, use your AVR programmer of choice to program
``src/sample/avr/sample.hex`` onto your target AVR device.
