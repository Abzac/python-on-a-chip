Purpose
-------

PyMite is a flyweight Python interpreter written from scratch
to execute on 8-bit microcontrollers.  PyMite supports a subset
of the Python 2.0 syntax and can execute a subset of the
Python 2.0 bytecodes.  PyMite can be compiled, tested and
executed on a desktop computer and also targeted for 8-bit
embedded systems with resources as limited as 64 KiB of
program memory (flash) and 4 KiB of RAM.

Build
-----

Perform the following steps to build PyMite and the included
sample application for the desktop:

    1. In the project root, run ``make`` to create ``libpmvm.a``
    2. In the project root, run ``make check`` to make an executable for
       ``src/tests/t003.*``

To build for the ATmega103:

    1. In the project root, run ``make clean; make check TARGET=ATMEGA103``
       to make an executable for ``src/tests/t003.*``

The development system should have installed the GNU Compiler
Collection version 3.4 or later and Python 2.0 or later.
The author also uses avr-gcc to target Atmel AVR
microcontrollers.

PyMite is developed on Mac OS X 10.4 and should also compile on
GNU/Linux and Cygwin operating systems.  Since PyMite is so
deeply embedded, it does not rely on many libraries.
When compiling for the AVR, it will need avr-libc.

PyMite builds as an archive.  The user should then build his
own main() function following given examples and link in
``libpymvm.a`` and the appropriate PyMite native libraries.

Release Notes
-------------

This is PyMite release 02

* Release 02, 2006/08/11

    - #27:  Create Release v 02 package.
    - N/A:  VM funcs modified so that return objects are by
      reference and funcs return a PyReturn_t for internal
      error checking.  Library modules are broken until they
      are modified similarly (issue #28).
    - N/A:  The pmImgCreator.py script was modified to work via
      the command line. pmImgCreator GUI is deprecated.
    - N/A:  Converted many files' EOLs to Unix.

* Release 01, 2003/03/18

    - N/A:  Initial release made for PyCon 2003.
    - N/A:  Compiles for desktop and Atmel ATmega103.

Thanks
------

My personal thanks go out to these people for their contribution to PyMite:

    - Philipp Adelt: Enhancements to pmImgCreator.py and reports on general use.
