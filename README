Purpose
-------

PyMite is a flyweight Python interpreter written from scratch to execute
on 8-bit and larger microcontrollers with resources as limited as 32 KiB
of program memory (flash) and 4 KiB of RAM. PyMite supports a subset of
the Python syntax and can execute a subset of the Python bytecodes.
PyMite can also be compiled, tested and executed on a desktop computer.

Build
-----

Perform the following steps to build PyMite and the included
system tests on the desktop:

    1. In the project root, run ``make`` to create ``libpmvm.a``
    2. In the project root, run ``make check`` to build and run
       the unit tests and the system tests.

To build for AVR targets like the ATmega103 (refer to the Makefile for others):

    1. In the project root, run ``make clean; make check TARGET=AVR``
       to make an executable for ``src/tests/t003.*``

The development system should have installed the GNU Compiler
Collection version 3.4 or later and Python 2.4 or later.
The author also uses avr-gcc to target Atmel AVR microcontrollers.

PyMite is developed on Mac OS X and should also compile on
GNU/Linux and Cygwin operating systems.  Since PyMite is so
deeply embedded, it does not rely on many libraries.
When compiling for the AVR, it will need avr-libc.

PyMite builds as an archive.  The user should then build his
own main() function following examples in ``src/samples/`` and link in
``libpmvm.a`` and the appropriate PyMite native libraries.
