Purpose
-------

This document describes the implementation and use of classes
in the PyMite virtual machine (VM).  In doing so, it serves as a design
document for the PyMite developer and a user manual for the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

PyMite shall support a special form of class-like objects called Lame Classes
which are nothing like `Python classes`_.  Lame Classes are unique to PyMite
and grew from PyMite's need to have class-like capability.  Lame Classes allow
the user to create an instance of a module; where the module name becomes the
class name and the module's functions become the class's methods.
Lame Classes support single inheritence, but not constructors, destructors
or anything else from traditional object oriented classes.

The downside of Lame Classes is that a PyMite program would not run on
standard desktop Python.

Background
----------

PyMite would benefit from implementing the ``assert`` statement.
The ``assert`` statement requires the ``AssertionError`` exception to exist,
which requires exceptions in general to exist.  Exceptions benefit from
class-like inheritence, which, finally, brings about the need for classes in
PyMite.

Supporting real Python classes was considered and an implementation was
attempted, but due to the tradeoffs that PyMite had already made, implementing
real classes required several ugly hacks and special cases in the interpreter.
Real classes were shelved in favor of something lighter and simpler.

The term `Lame Classes` was created by the author who acknowledges that these
classes are nothing like classes from Python or `OOP`_ in general, but serve
the purpose of classes given the constraints of PyMite's embedded target
devices.

Implementation
--------------

Lame Classes shall use modules as if they were classes and shall have a special
builtin-in function to create an instance of the "class."  The instance shall
receive a copy of the module's attributes so that the instance may access the
class's methods.  

A module that wishes to act as a Lame Class must define the specially-named
attribute, ``__p``, which stores the module's parent object.  Keeping this
reference to the parent object is what allows inheritence in Lame Classes.
If a class does not have a specific parent object to inherit, the builtin
class, ``Object``, should be used.

Lame Classes do not support constructors like Python's ``__init__()`` function,
but instead the author recommends the following convention as a work-around.
Define the method, ``ini()`` in the class and call it immediately after
creating an instance of the class.

An instance of a class is made by using the built-in function, 
``Instantiate()`` like this::
    
    hexagon = Instantiate(Shape)
    hexagon.ini(6)

In this case, a hexagon is an instance of the ``Shape`` class and sets
a value using the initializer method, ``ini()``.
