===================
PyMite Self Testing
===================

:Author:    Dean Hall

Purpose
-------

This document describes PyMite's self tests.  In doing so, it serves as an
informational  document for the PyMite developer and is of little use to
the PyMite user.

Overview
--------

PyMite has two types of self tests: unit tests and system tests found in
``src/tests/unit/`` and ``src/tests/system/``, respectively.  `Unit tests`_
are meant to validate that a particular module of source code is working
properly.  `System tests`_, on the other hand, are conducted on a complete,
integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance to its design and
to expose any regressions to previous defects.

Unit Tests
----------

Three unit test frameworks were evaluated for use in the PyMite project:
`MinUnit`_, `CuTest`_ and `Check`_.  MinUnit is exactly what it says, a minimal 
unit testing framework for C.  However, it does not provide a mechanism for
grouping tests into suites or reporting failures in a useful fashion.

The Check framework is at the other end of the spectrum.  It provides a
complete set of assert statements and a robust reporting system.  The down
sides of Check are that it is a somewhat large package to try to include in
PyMite.

The CuTest framework is just right.  It is one .c file and one .h file.
It has a handful of useful assert statements and reporting on stdout.
The CuTest license allows direct inclusion of CuTest source in any project.
CuTest is a quick learn if you are familiar with unit testing.
