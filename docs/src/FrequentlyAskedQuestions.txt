What is PyMite?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMite is a flyweight Python interpreter written from scratch to execute
on 8-bit and larger microcontrollers with resources as limited as 64 KB of
program memory (flash) and 8 KB of RAM. PyMite supports a subset of
the Python 2.5 syntax and can execute a subset of the Python 2.5 bytecodes.
PyMite can also be compiled, tested and executed on a desktop computer.


Under what terms is PyMite licensed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMite is offered under one of two licenses: commercial or open source.
The GNU Public License version 2.0 is the open source license.
Please `contact the author`_ for terms of the commercial license.

Is a ready-to-go solution available?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not yet.


How do I get PyMite running?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download PyMite from http://pymite.python-hosting.com/ and follow the
instructions in the README to build and run PyMite on the desktop.

Read BuildSystem_ to learn how to build PyMite for a microcontroller target.
To compile and flash PyMite to a microcontroller is highly dependent on which
microcontroller you have.  I cannot answer this for you.  You'll have to find
out how to do this for your specific target microcontroller.

What microcontrollers are supported?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMite's build system currently supports Atmel AVR and AT91SAM7
microcontrollers.  However, your AVR will need 8 KB of RAM or more.
The target size used to be 4 KB, but PyMite has since grown.


What microcontroller is recommended?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The more RAM you have, the better.  I recommend an AVR32 or ARM7TDMI with
64 KB or more of RAM.


What do I need on my computer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 2.5 or 2.6.  Python 3.0 is not yet tested, so avoid it for now.
You'll need gcc to compile for the desktop, avr-gcc for AVR, arm-elf-gcc for
AT91SAM7S, etc.  If your OS is a version of Windows, I recommend using Cygwin_
so you have a Unix-like terminal to run make and gcc.
